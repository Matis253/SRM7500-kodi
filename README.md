###About
Hello, I have a RF remote Philips SRM-7500 and I use a OSMC system. Previous version of lirc.conf, lircmap.xml was too old to work well.

So I decided to rewrite form zero these configurations, and make a tutorial for others to also be able to use this remote for his beloved KODI system.
All 46 buttons on the remote is working, and a longpress function.

##Instalation
